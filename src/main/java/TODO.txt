- [X???] average speed is wrong in multi threading
- [X] Implement the test map to see if the neural networks actually learn
- [X] save the selected parents NN into files
- /!\ Auto select best cars (fit best racetrack -> how to get)
- benchmark render car and multithread it if need be
- [X] CIRCUIT REFACTOR -> MORE ABSTRACT CLASS
- [X] abstraction of spinners -> not passed to circuit constructor
- [X] Circuit -> remove population attribute
- /!!!\ [NN IACar] replace acceleration with deltaArrows
- /!!\ Import model -> dimensions define nb of arrows

- Crossover cars are either bad or too similar to parents
