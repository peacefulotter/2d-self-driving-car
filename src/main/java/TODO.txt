- [X???] average speed is wrong in multi threading
- Implement the test map to see if the neural networks actually learn
- [X] save the selected parents NN into files
- Auto select best cars (fit best racetrack -> how to get)
- benchmark render car and multithread it if need be
- CIRCUIT REFACTOR -> ABSTRACT CLASS
- abstraction of spinners -> not passed to circuit constructor

- Crossover cars are either bad or too similar to parents
