- [X] Circuit should hold a list of Car[] and not IACar[]
- [X???] average speed is wrong in multi threading
- [X] Implement the test map to see if the neural networks actually learn
- [X] save the selected parents NN into files
- /!\ Auto select best cars (fit best racetrack -> how to get)
- benchmark render car and multithread it if need be
- [X] CIRCUIT REFACTOR -> MORE ABSTRACT CLASS
- [X] abstraction of spinners -> not passed to circuit constructor
- [X] Circuit -> remove population attribute
- /!!!\ [NN IACar] add reflected arrow to the neural network input
- [X] Import model -> dimensions define nb of arrows
- Arrow length flickers on hitbox edges
- add nbArrows + nbFutureArrows field when saving and importing nn
- IACar constructor refactor -> nn details should be abstracted + Builder for dimension + activation used in Main?
- dead cars throws index out of bounds

- Crossover cars are either bad or too similar to parents
