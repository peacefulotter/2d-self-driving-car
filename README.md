## Description
Neural networks that evolve using genetic algorithm. Cars that drove the best are selected and used for the next generation (parents). After repeating this process 5-10 times, some cars are able to drive around the track at least once.'

## Showcase

## Requirements
- JavaFX

## Bugs
- IllegalArgument sometimes when creating a new gen
- Parents are not properly included in the next gen

## Future work
- Make the selection automatic
- Add bonuses to encourage the network to use certain driving lines that are optimized for speed
